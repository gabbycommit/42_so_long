# 42_so_long

Welcome to my 42PG Pre Kick-off Project — **So Long**!

This project focuses on developing a **2D grid-based game** where the player navigates through a map, collects all collectibles, and reaches the exit to win.

As a bonus feature, I added enemies and a hidden key to increase the challenge and gameplay depth.

Since So Long is no longer part of the 42 Common Core, we are allowed to choose whether to use C with MiniLibX or Python with a supported graphics library.

For this project, I chose to develop the game using **Python and Pygame**.

- Player must **collect all collectibles**, before the exit key appears on map
- Player must **collect the exit key** before reaching the exit to win

## 🗺️Map Format

The map can be created manually in a .ber file by following the rules below:

- All required elements except walls must be reachable
- The map must contain:
  - empty spaces ('**0**')
  - walls ('**1**')
  - exactly one player ('**P**')
  - at least one collectible ('**C**')
  - exactly one exit key ('**K**')
  - exactly one exit ('**E**')
  - enemies ('**T**') are optional
